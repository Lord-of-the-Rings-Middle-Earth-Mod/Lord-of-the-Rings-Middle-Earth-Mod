## What Contributions are looked for?
When it comes to contributions, any kind of contribution whether small or big is welcome and appreciated.
If you wish to contribute, please look through the issues listed for something that interests you.
We prefer to get issues for the next planned Milestone done first, but that is not a must.

If you are new to the project or open source in general, 
look for issues with the tag *Good first issue* those are small and meant for newcomers.

## Coding Guidelines
*Coding Guidelines still need to be written down, but they will be looked for during Pull Requests and you will get Feedback there.*
