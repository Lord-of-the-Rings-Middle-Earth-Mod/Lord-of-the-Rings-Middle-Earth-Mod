## Branching and Issues

### Branching
We use a branching model based on [GitFlow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
In most cases you will only come into contact with feature branches, which are branches created from the develop branch.
When you are done with your work, you create a Pull Request to merge your feature branch into the develop branch.
Maintainers will check Pull Requests regularly and give feedback on them or merge them.

### Issues
We use GitHub Issues to track bugs, features and other tasks, all Issues can be seen with their current status on our [Issue Board](https://github.com/orgs/Lord-of-the-Rings-Middle-Earth-Mod/projects/2)
When working on an Issue, always keep it in the appropriate column of the Issue Board, so everyone can see what the status is.
| Column/Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Backlog | Issues that are not yet assigned to a milestone/release and have lower priority |
| To Do | Issues that are assigned to a milestone/release but not yet worked on |
| In Progress | Issues that are currently being worked on |
| Review | Issues that are done and have a Pull Request waiting on being reviewed by a maintainer |
| Testing | Issues that are already merged into dev and are waiting on testing (mainly animations and code) |
| Done | Issues that are all tested and only wait on the release. |
| Closed | Issues that are released |

## Code



### Coding Guidelines
*Coding Guidelines still need to be written down, but they will be looked for during Pull Requests and you will get Feedback there.*

What is to be considered are the following points:
- Proper Commenting
  - JavaDoc at every Class describing shortly what the class is used for
    - Exceptions are the Main Classes: LordOfTheRingsMiddleEarthMod, LordOfTheRingsMiddleEarthModClient, LordOfTheRingsMiddleEarthModDataGenerator
  - JavaDoc at every Method describing shortly what the method is used for, as well as listing parameters and output 
    - Exceptions are Constructors, Getter, Setter, ToString, Equals and Hash Methods
- Versioning is done using SemanticVersioning as described [here](https://semver.org/).
- Releases are done by maintainers only
- Every Change needs a Pull-Request(PR), only maintainers can approve PRs
- Sun Coding Convention for Java is to be used
- Every Issue has a branch
- Any feature noticeable for the players should be listed in the changelog before creating a pull request
- Before a release, the changelog should always be up-to-date
