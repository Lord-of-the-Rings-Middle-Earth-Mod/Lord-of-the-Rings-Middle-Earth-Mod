### Coding Guidelines

What is to be considered are the following points:
- Proper Commenting
  - JavaDoc at every Class describing shortly what the class is used for
    - Exceptions are the Main Classes: LordOfTheRingsMiddleEarthMod, LordOfTheRingsMiddleEarthModClient, LordOfTheRingsMiddleEarthModDataGenerator
  - JavaDoc at every Method describing shortly what the method is used for, as well as listing parameters and output 
    - Exceptions are Constructors, Getter, Setter, ToString, Equals and Hash Methods
- Versioning is done using SemanticVersioning as described [here](https://semver.org/).
- Releases are done by maintainers only
- Every Change needs a Pull-Request(PR), only maintainers can approve PRs
- Sun Coding Convention for Java is to be used
- Every Issue has a branch
- Any feature noticeable for the players should be listed in the changelog before creating a pull request
- Before a release, the changelog should always be up-to-date
