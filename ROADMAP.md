Therefor we´ll add items for each "Recipe" that unlocks the recipe, if the item is used. If a player already has gotten a recipe-item from a quest he can not obtain the same item from a quest again.
(Player has obtained the Gondor Chestplate Recipe Item by a quest and won´t be getting this again from a quest.)
### Building Blocks
In addition to the vanilla blocks we aim to add a large variety of new building blocks to the game.

#### Stone Types and Building Blocks
We will be adding a vast variety of stone types, in order to make the map as realistic as possible.

Faction Bricks can be made from any stone, and the type of stone will than define the color of the bricks, while the faction defines the "texture".
Each Stone type will have the same brick and other block variations that can be crafted from them.

All recipies will be possible with the stonecutter, if the block is crafted from 1 base block (aka bricks, tiles etc all come from base aka are doable within there if the input is the base block. Cobbled bricks are made from the cobbled block aka are doable within the stonecutter if the input is the cobbled block)

The full pallet per stone type will than be:
- Base -> The stone as it generates in the world
  - Stairs

  - Stais
  - Slab

  - Slab
- Carved Faction Brick -> a faction specific carving in the brick, optained by carving a brick

For all Cobbled, Bricks, Tiles, Cobbled Bricks, Pillars, Pavement, Fancy Bricks, Faction Bricks and Faction Pillars we will have the following "states"
- Normal -> The normal look of the block
- Cracked -> The normal look of the block but with some cracks showing age, obtained by breaking the block with a stonemasons hammer
- Mossy -> The normal look of the block, but covered in a bit of moss, crafted from the block + vines

## NPC Variants
In order to make the world and mod feel more immersive, we plan to introduce variants of each NPC, that show different behavior and maybe also have different models.
One Example could be 2 hobbit variants, the chilling hobbit and the "fat" hobbit, the chilling hobbit would from time to time sit down and smoke his pipe, while the fat hobbit would instead sit down to eat something or so.

## Crafting Station upgrades and gear tiers
Long term the Crafting System would have different tiers with a simple base block and multiblock structures for higher tiers.
Higher tier crafting structures can craft higher gear tiers or have other benefits to using them.

## Shields
Each faction deserves it´s own shield obviously

## High Customisation with Datapacks
As the Lord of the Rings Fandom is not only interested in the 3rd age, but also the first and second age, we want to make the mod highly customisable with datapacks to allow changing the mod into a first or second age mod with just datapacks, instead of writing submods.
Customisable should be the following:
- Factions with their Allies and Enemies
- World Generation (Map based)
---
# Ideas
## Wood Hardness
An idea is to implement Wood Hardness based on Real Life, also having different Blast resistence, and properties. This would also include a overhaul of charcoal, as charcoals heat and burning duration is based on the used wood type.
- Hardwood takes longer to chop, burns longer, makes longer burning charcoal
- Softwood is quicker to chop, burns shorter but hotter, makes hotter burning charcoal, that doesn´t last as long

## Stone Hardness
We would like to adjust the Hardness of stone to real life equivilant and also having different properties based on that, like if it drops cobble or not and if it has a cobbled variant in general
- Soft stone mines faster is less blast resistent
- hard stone mines longer is more blast resistent

## Smelting temperatures
Different metals have different smelting temperatures and we would love to implement that in some way into the mod. Different temperatures are achieved by different types of charcoal etc.

## Seasons
Seasons would influence the weather and the growth of crops etc.

## Climate Zones
Climate Zones would be having an influence on the weather and what can be grown there etc.
The Climate Zones would be based on the Atlas of Middle Earth

## Map World Gen
A world generation, that would be taking a simple image as input and generates the world from that.
This would allow for a complete custom world generation with a simple datapack

## Hyper Realistic World Gen
Hyper Realistic World Generation, where all Rivers would actually be flowing downhills, Erosion would be implemented etc.

## Ring Forging
The forging of magical rings, that would give effects etc.

## Transport Carts
Transport carts, that could be pulled by specific mobs and have storage or so.

## Flying Ridable Mobs
Fellbeasts and Dragons are part of lord of the rings, and we would love to add them

## Toggable Lore Build Generation
Lore Builds are a big part of immersion, and to make the world feel alive we´d love to add lore builds.
If lore builds would be generated of not would be toggable for those who wish to build the lorebuilds themselves

## Map Size Setting
To make the map more usable for servers of different size we would like to set a map size setting for the world generation that can be edited within a config file

## Various Deco upgrades and Blocks
- 3D detailed Blocks
- Deco Blocks

## Survival Aspects
- Thirst and Sleep deprival, that needs to be watched after by the player
- Having to get some pebbles lying about in order to break a tree
- Plenty of "realism" additions and changes
